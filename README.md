# Pot Limit Omaha Hand Selection Trainer

## Problem Domain

In Texas Hold'em there are 1,326 possible combinations of hold cards (cards dealt to each player). It is common that players will try to memorize these hands and decide what how to play them pre-flop. Pot Limit Omaha has similar rules to Texas Hold'em with the key difference that you are dealt 4 cards instead of 2. This means there are 270,725 possible combinations. Good luck memorizing that.

The idea of this app is to allow players to drill themselves on which hands they should play and which ones they shouldn't by presenting them with a hand and having them choose Raise/Fold. Hopefully players will develop an inutive sense for what is playable rather than trying to memorize a quarter million combinations.

## Design and Features

The app is very simple. Simply decide if you think the hand is playable or not. If it is playable choose Raise, if it is not choose Fold. You will be told if your answer is correct/incorrect and then if you want to play another hand you can hit the Next Hand button. This goes on forever.
